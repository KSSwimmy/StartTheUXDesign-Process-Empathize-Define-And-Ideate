### Recruit interview participants

As you start to think about conducting interviews for UX research, you might be wondering: How can I find and recruit people who want to be interviewed? Well, this reading will guide you through just that!

#### Determine interview goals 

You want to ensure that the interviews you conduct are worthwhile, both for you and for the participants. To make the most of your time together, you need to determine clear goals for the interview. As a UX designer, what do you want to learn from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? 

Here are some examples of common research goals when it comes to empathizing with users: 

- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
- I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing. 

#### Write interview questions

With the goals of the interview in mind, you can write the questions that you’ll ask real people during interviews. The more aligned the interview questions are with your goals, the more useful the data you obtain will be. 

There are a few best practices to keep in mind when writing interview questions:

- **Ask open-ended questions.** Open-ended questions allow the person being interviewed to answer freely, instead of with a simple “yes” or “no.” For example, if you’re designing an app to help people find dog walkers, you should ask “Could you describe your experience with finding and scheduling dog walkers?” instead of “Have you ever used an app to find a dog walker?”. Keep in mind that the questions you ask during interviews should not lead or pressure participants towards a desired response; instead, asking open-ended questions lets participants share their true thoughts and perspectives.
- **Keep questions short and simple.** It should be easy for interview participants to understand what you’re asking. 
- **Ask follow-up questions.** During the empathize phase of the design process, interviews should be conversational, so encouraging participants to elaborate is a best practice. After a participant answers an interview question, try asking them “Why?” or use the phrase, “Tell me more about that” to keep the conversation flowing.

#### Use a screener to select a representative sample of study participants 

It’s important to recognize that asking demographic questions can be a sensitive and challenging space to navigate. Be conscious and mindful of the questions you ask in screener surveys and how you ask them. Frame questions in a way that is respectful and inclusive, and make questions optional if they ask about demographic data. You might want to preface demographic questions with a short explanation of why the question is being asked. For example, “In the spirit of inclusive design, we are asking these questions to make sure we’re reaching out to a diverse group of people.”

Interviewing participants with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities is extremely important to ensure that your designs are accessible and equitable. A **representative sample** is a small group of participants who represent both the target user group and user groups that are often marginalized. Interviewing a representative sample will help you improve the overall user experience of your product because inclusive design benefits everyone. Ultimately, the research you conduct should help you create great experiences for all users!  

##### Find research participants

At this point, you’ve determined the goals of the interview, written interview questions, and created a screener survey to find a representative sample of study participants. You’re ready to start recruiting participants! 

How and where you find research study participants depends on the company you work for, the type of product you’re designing, time constraints for the research, the project’s budget, and the accessibility of target users. Based on these project details, you can choose from a variety of ways to find research participants. 

- **Personal network.** As a UX designer in training, your personal network is a great way to find people to interview! Think about family, friends, or colleagues who fit the demographics of the target users you’re designing for.
- **Existing user base.** If you’re conducting research and creating designs for an organization with an existing user base, you’ll likely be able to recruit participants from that group of established connections. This might not be the case for your current project in this program, but recruiting from an existing user base is pretty common in the real world. 
- **Online.** Alternatively, if you’re coming up with designs for an imaginary company or a newly established business, the easiest way to recruit participants for your study is online. You can use your own social media to find research participants. Or, there are websites created specifically to connect with research participants, like UserTesting and User Interviews. You can also find online groups that have users with the demographic characteristics that you want to interview. For example, if you’re designing an app for parents, you might find an online group about parenting. Before you post in an online community, make sure to check group rules or ask an administrator for permission to ask for research participation!
- **Hallway testing.** If recruiting participants online doesn’t seem like an option, a less formal way to recruit for your study is to ask people in person. You can use a recruiting method known as hallway testing, which means asking people that pass by in the “hallway” to try the product you’re designing. Try to position yourself in a location where you’re most likely to encounter your product’s target audience, like a dog park or a coffee shop. Hallway testing can be effective if you’re recruiting a small number of participants, if you have limited time, or if you want to conduct research for free. However, finding participants in this way is risky because the people you collect feedback from might not have all the characteristics of your product’s potential users.
- **Third-party recruiting agencies.** Some organizations have a budget to hire third-party research recruiting agencies. Recruiting agencies are useful because they save you time and can often reach diverse users.  

##### Reach out to participants

Once you’ve identified potential research participants, send an email that introduces the project and yourself as the researcher. If you have the budget to provide an incentive to motivate or encourage people to participate in a research study, like a gift card, include that in the email, too.

Here’s an example of an email that could be sent to potential research participants:


>Hello [Participant Name],
>
>I am currently working on a project for a certificate program where I need to conduct interviews about [explain the project]. 
>
>Your participation in the research study would be very valuable to help us [summary of project goals]. Details of the study are shared below. 
>
>Location: [Address and link to map]
>Study dates: [Date range]
>Time: [Time range]
>Session length: [Estimated length of time for each interview]
>With your permission, we will record each interview to help us decide how to improve our product. Recordings will only be shared with project team members for the scope of this project. A consent form is attached to this email that you need to sign and send back. 
>
>If you have any questions, please contact me through email at [your email address]. 
>
>If you are interested in being interviewed, please let me know when you are available between [date range of study] and the hours of [time range of study].
>
>Sincerely,
>
>[Your Name]

Research is an essential part of the UX design process and empathizing with users. Taking time to outline the goals for your research and recruit a representative sample of participants will help ensure the feedback you obtain is valuable. Good luck recruiting!

### Build an empathy map from an interview transcript

To empathize with users, UX designers and researchers often conduct interviews. Interviews can help you understand users’ perspectives and learn their pain points. But interviewing users is only the beginning of the UX research process! While interviews provide a lot of insight, empathy mapping will bring you closer to identifying the real needs of your users. 

Remember, **empathy maps** are easily understood charts that explain everything UX designers have learned about a particular type of user. Empathy maps break down each interview into digestible pieces of information.

In this reading, you'll learn about **one-user empathy maps**, which are empathy maps that are created by taking one user's interview transcript and turning it into an empathy map.

##### Empathy mapping in action

Imagine your company is building a new app for scheduling dog walkers. The purpose of the app is to match qualified dog walkers with customers who need help caring for their dogs, similar to a ride-sharing or home-sharing app. You’re on the UX team, and your team is in the early stages of designing the app and understanding user pain points. 

A colleague has already interviewed dog owners and professional dog walkers who are expected to use the app regularly. It’s now your responsibility to summarize each interview transcript. An interview transcript is a typed or written version of a conversation that’s been recorded. Your job is to summarize the transcripts using empathy maps and present the maps to the rest of your team.

Check out this example of an interview transcript with Makayla, a fourth-grade teacher with two dogs. You can read the entire transcript below, or you can reference this document if you want the interview transcript in a separate window to follow along as you complete the rest of the reading.

#### Interview transcript

Name: Makayla Scott

Situation: Makayla is a 45-year-old, female-identifying teacher who lives in Houston, Texas. She has two dogs. Makayla has a demanding job as a fourth grade teacher. She also volunteers as a volleyball coach after school. Makayla’s partner works full-time as a pediatric surgeon and regularly switches between working the night-shift and the day-shift at a local hospital.  

**[UX Researcher]** Can you describe your current work situation and how you take care of your dogs? 

**[Makayla]** I work as a teacher, and I coach volleyball after school, so my puppers Reggie and Snowball are often left home alone for long periods of time. My partner works on-call in a hospital, which often means 12-hour day or night shifts. When our schedules overlap, we definitely need help walking Reggie and Snowball.

**[UXR]** What challenges do you face managing the care of your dogs? How does this make you feel?

**[Makayla]** I love my dogs! They have so much energy. If it was up to them, they’d go on five walks a day! But, with our schedules, it’s hard to take them out as much as we’d like. I can manage taking them out first thing in the morning and again in the evening. Sometimes, I pay my next door neighbor’s 17-year-old son to walk them. But, the real issue comes from our travel schedule. My partner and I like to take a lot of trips, and we can’t always take our pets with us. Planning our trips would be much easier if we could book a dog walker. 

Our neighbor’s son is graduating this year, and his schedule is becoming inconsistent. I can’t rely on him at the last minute, and I worry that he doesn’t really have the right experience for when I’m on longer trips. I mean, sure, a 17-year-old kid is fine for daily walks. But what if he takes the dogs for a weekend and Snowball gets sick? How will he know what to do, or if he should call me? It definitely makes me worry, but I can’t spend the money on a doggy daycare.

There are also a lot of places I can’t bring Reggie, who is a much bigger dog than Snowball. He’s not hypoallergenic like Snowball is. And, because he’s so big, even bringing him on road trips can be a struggle. We just moved to Houston last year, and there aren’t many people we can ask for help. I’ve considered putting up an ad online, but I’m not sure how I would know who’s safe to allow in my home or who’s good with dogs.  

**[UXR]** Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved?

**[Makayla]** I’d love to find a dog walker that I could prescreen and learn more about. And I’d love a way to book someone consistently. Maybe someone who can do weekends regularly and can commit to specific times while I’m working. Ideally, I could schedule dog sitting days in advance. I just need a consistent dog walker that I can screen to make sure they’re safe and good with animals! I’m willing to pay a little more to get something like this instead of constantly requesting help from my neighbor. 

#### Creating an empathy map

Now that you’ve had a chance to review Makayla’s interview transcript, let’s break down the steps for creating an empathy map. As a reminder, here’s what an empathy map includes: 

**Step 1: Add the user’s name.** Include the name of the person interviewed in your empathy map. Having a name attached to it will help if you ever need to look back at the original transcript or research, and it’ll distinguish this map from other maps you create.

**Step 2: The “SAYS” square.** Use verbatim quotes from the interview. In other words, write down exactly what the person said; don’t summarize it in your own words. If you summarize a quote, you might accidentally interpret the user’s meaning incorrectly. It’s also helpful to try to capture themes in the interview that relate to the product you’re researching. For example, if the user restates the same problem several times during the interview, then it’s probably a major pain point. Pay special attention to challenges your user states, and record any desired benefits or expectations they mention. 

**Step 3: The “THINKS” square.** Here, you can summarize the thoughts expressed by the user. Add feelings the user conveyed through body language, tone, or other noticeable indicators, even if they didn’t verbally express them to you. You can make inferences for some of these feelings, but you have to be careful not to make assumptions about the user. For example, Makayla expressed concern about her neighbor’s teenage son and mentioned his age and qualifications. An assumption is that Makayla wants an adult dog walker. An inference is that she wants a dog walker with a car and a driver's license who can take the dog to the emergency vet. You can always ask your user for clarification on their body language if you find any contradictions.  

**Step 4: The “DOES” square.** Makayla gave us quite a bit of detail on steps and actions she takes to overcome the dog-walking challenges she faces. All those actions can go in the “DOES” square.

**Step 5: The “FEELS” square.** List the feelings the user expresses. The notes you include may overlap with some of what you listed in the “THINKS” square. That’s okay! This process is meant to be a thorough documentation of your observations. If you’re the person performing the interview, you might notice signs of feelings like anger, frustration, excitement, and others. If the user doesn’t explicitly mention any feelings during the interview, you can probe for feelings with the question: “How does this make you feel?”

#### Empathy map example for Makayla

Now that you’ve reviewed the interview transcript and the steps for creating an empathy map, let’s use our template to take action! Here’s an empathy map for Makayla:

###### SAYS

- “I’m not sure how I would know who’s safe to allow in my home or who’s good with dogs.”
- “I’d love to find a dog walker that I could prescreen.”
- “I’d love a way to book someone consistently.”
- “Ideally, I could schedule dog-sitting days in advance.”
- “...there aren’t many people we can ask for help”
- “I’m willing to pay a little more to get...this”

###### THINKS

- Wants to book recurring dog walkers
- Would like to prescreen dog walkers
- Would like to find dog walkers in advance 
- Dog walking is expensive
- Would like a dog walker who has experience with animals
- Doesn’t know enough people to ask them to walk her dogs 
- Wants a more consistent dog walker

###### DOES 

- Works a full-time job as a teacher
- Walks her dogs first thing in the morning and evening
- Pays her neighbor, a 17-year-old high school student, to -  walk the dogs 

###### FEELS

- Guilty when she can’t take her dogs for walks
- Sad she can’t spend more time with her dogs
- Sad she can’t take her dogs on vacation
- Worried about finding a consistent, dedicated dog walker that can commit to her schedule
- Worried about her larger dog’s needs 
- Worried about her current dog walker’s ability to manage a potential sudden illness in her dog
 

This empathy map breaks down all the points that your team will need to determine how your app can meet Makayla’s needs. The real challenge starts when you lay out the empathy maps from all of your user interviews and figure out how each of your potential users’ needs overlap. 

#### Types of empathy maps

It's important to understand that there are two types of empathy maps: **one-user empathy maps** and **aggregated empathy maps** (also known as "multiple-user empathy maps"). One-user empathy maps are created by taking one user's interview transcript and turning it into an empathy map, like the example earlier in this reading. This approach helps designers distill a single user's thoughts, feelings, and traits into a format that's easier to gather data from. 

The other kind of empathy map, an aggregated empathy map, represents a group of users who share similar thoughts, opinions, or qualities. Aggregated empathy maps are created by creating multiple one-user empathy maps from interview transcripts, then combining the maps where users expressed similar things into a new empathy map. This helps designers identify segments, or groups of people with similar tendencies, who will use the product. The insights in aggregated empathy maps allow designers to identify themes, which helps them better empathize with the groups they are designing for. To learn more about the different kinds of empathy maps, check out this article on empathy mapping from the Nielsen Norman Group. 

You’re beginning to understand what it means to empathize with your users. Each time you interact with a potential user, you get a little closer to understanding their perspectives and pain points. Good luck!

### Identify user pain points

Pain points are any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need.

Types of Pain Points 

- Financial 
- Product 
- Process 
- Support 

These are frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B.

### Reading: Learn more about personas

At this point in the course, you’ve learned about feeling empathy for users and building empathy maps to identify users’ pain points. You are on your way to learning all about the users that you'll design a product for! 

Now, it’s time to start personifying users. Keeping in mind everything that you’ve learned so far, you’ll soon build your first persona. **Personas** are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Each persona that you create will represent a group of users with similar characteristics that you’ve learned about through your research. Personas are key to the design process because they reflect the lifestyles of users and give your team an idea of how to meet users’ needs or challenges. 

In the world of UX design, **the user always comes first**. But to put user needs first, we have to know who we’re talking about. So let’s explore how to build personas. 

##### Building personas

Personas are created by conducting user research and identifying common pain points, which are UX issues that frustrate and block the user from getting what they need from a product.

As you create personas, look for the most common themes in your data and group the users who personify those themes together. For example, imagine that the data collected from user interviews for the dog walker app shows that a lot of potential users between the ages of 45 and 60 are concerned about dog walkers having access to their homes. That would definitely be a pain point you’d want to include in a persona that represents that specific age group of users.

Generally, creating 3 to 8 personas is enough to represent the majority of a product’s user base. Think of personas as an overview of all of your research and interviews. While it’s important for personas to accurately represent users, it’s impossible to meet every one of their specific needs. Personas are also context-specific, meaning they should be focused on the behaviors and goals of users interacting with the product effectively.

For the dog walker app, think about a scenario from the perspective of a dog owner:

- Daniela is a 48-year-old freelance film producer who lives with their partner Priya and their two children in Atlanta, Georgia. The family recently adopted a golden retriever puppy named Cisco. 

- The family takes regular trips with the kids for gymnastics competitions, and Daniela often travels for long periods of time when filming. Daniela wants to find someone to take care of the puppy, Cisco, while the family is away or busy. 

- Daniela’s biggest concern is trusting a stranger to come into their home and to take care of their puppy. Daniela would be most comfortable hiring someone who knows how to properly care for puppies and can take Cisco on walks and to dog parks. 

Here's what a persona might include for Daniela, using the persona template that was shown in the video:

![](/Week1/w1images/persona.png)

You can use the information in personas to create designs that speak directly to users, like Daniela. This ensures users have the best experience when using your product! For example, in your designs, you might want to indicate that the dog walkers are screened by the app and must pass background checks, which would reassure users like Daniela that their dog will be safe.

Here’s a pro tip: Get your team's opinion on the product’s users before you build personas. Then, after you build personas, review those suggestions from your team and compare them to the personas you created. Point out how the data validated or contradicted their suggestions. Everyone on your team needs to understand the personas in order to truly connect with your users. 

There are many ways you can create personas. To get started, you can use the persona template from videos in this course. You can also explore a variety of persona templates like these persona templates and examples on Medium and these persona templates and examples on Xtensio. You might notice that some personas are very long and detailed! Or, you might notice different topics in the persona examples that we haven't covered in this course. Feel free to explore and use a persona template that works best for you and your design project.
