# WEEK 1

### Introduction to Course 2 - SECTION 



##### Choose a prompt using Sharpen
You might be thinking: There are so many products I want to design! How will I ever choose? To help narrow the scope, **your first project will focus on designing a mobile app** to meet the specific need of a hypothetical business or organization. You’ll choose a prompt that will give you more specific guidelines. For example, your project prompt might be to design a mobile app for the checkout process at your favorite hometown restaurant. Or, the prompt might be to design an app for a rapper’s album pre-order. There are tens of thousands of project prompts you’ll be able to choose from — the choice is yours! 

You’ll find all of these project prompts from Sharpen, an online tool that creates randomized design prompts, in the next activity. The format of the prompts from Sharpen are similar in style to the prompts you'll be asked in real job interviews! Your first project will focus on designing a process within a mobile app, and the prompt generator will give you lots of ideas to choose from. 

To produce a prompt, click on the “New Challenge” button. You can refresh the prompt as many times as you want to find one that sparks your creative energy. For this project, you’ll choose just one prompt that you'll design over the next few courses of the program, so find one that really speaks to your interests or experiences. When you find a prompt that you like, take a screenshot or write it down, so that you can submit your choice of project prompt in an upcoming quiz.
