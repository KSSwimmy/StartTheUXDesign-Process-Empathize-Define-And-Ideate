# WEEK 1

### Introduction to Course 2 - SECTION 



##### Choose a prompt using Sharpen
You might be thinking: There are so many products I want to design! How will I ever choose? To help narrow the scope, **your first project will focus on designing a mobile app** to meet the specific need of a hypothetical business or organization. You’ll choose a prompt that will give you more specific guidelines. For example, your project prompt might be to design a mobile app for the checkout process at your favorite hometown restaurant. Or, the prompt might be to design an app for a rapper’s album pre-order. There are tens of thousands of project prompts you’ll be able to choose from — the choice is yours! 

You’ll find all of these project prompts from Sharpen, an online tool that creates randomized design prompts, in the next activity. The format of the prompts from Sharpen are similar in style to the prompts you'll be asked in real job interviews! Your first project will focus on designing a process within a mobile app, and the prompt generator will give you lots of ideas to choose from. 

To produce a prompt, click on the “New Challenge” button. You can refresh the prompt as many times as you want to find one that sparks your creative energy. For this project, you’ll choose just one prompt that you'll design over the next few courses of the program, so find one that really speaks to your interests or experiences. When you find a prompt that you like, take a screenshot or write it down, so that you can submit your choice of project prompt in an upcoming quiz.

### Introduction to UX research

##### UX Research 
UX research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.

##### Product Development Life Cycle
product development life cycle is the process used to take a product from an idea to reality.

User research is a continuous part of the product development life cycle and takes place before, during, and after phase 3: Design.

Research that takes place before anything is designed is usually called **foundational research**. Some UX teams might also call it strategic or generative research. All three terms mean the same thing, but in this course, we'll stick with foundational research.

**Post-launch research** can be used to evaluate how well a launch feature is meeting the needs of users.
##### Foundational Research 
###### Answers the questions:
- What should we build? 
- What are the user problems? 
- How can we solve them? 

UX Researcher Qualities 

- Empathy: Able to understand someone else's feelings or thought in a situation
- Pragmatism: Focused on reaching goals
- Collaboration: Can work with a range of people, personalities, and work styles.

### Reading: Learn more about UX research

There are two key parts to every UX design project: conducting research to learn about the users you’re designing for, and gathering feedback about their perspectives. UX design is all about putting the user first, and research helps designers understand those users. 

UX research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback. Your product design should be built upon research and facts, not assumptions. UX research aligns what you, as the designer, think the user needs with what the user actually needs. 

Remember the product development life cycle from an earlier course of the program? The **product development** life cycle has five stages — brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch — that take an idea for an app, website, or product to its launch. 

Let’s check out how research fits into the product development life cycle.

**Foundational research** is always done before you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens during the brainstorm stage (stage one) to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions. During this stage, you will also make personas and user stories, which you'll learn about soon. 

In foundational research, your goal is to figure out what the user needs and how to address those needs with your product. Strong foundational research can contradict your personal perspective on what a good solution might be. 

Questions you might consider during foundational research include:

- What should we build?
- What are the user’s problems?
- How can we solve those problems?
- Am I aware of my own biases, and am I able to filter them as I do research?

There are lots of research methods for conducting foundational research, but many of them are based on observations. Common foundational research methods include: 

- **Interviews:** A research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. You’ll often conduct interviews of your target users themselves.
- **Surveys:** An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.
- **Focus groups:** A small group of people whose reactions are studied. For example, your focus group might bring together eight users to discuss their perspectives about new features in your design. A focus group is usually run by a moderator who guides the group on a certain topic of conversation. 
- **Competitive audit:** An overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. You'll conduct your own competitive audit later in the course, so you will understand this research method well! 
- **Field studies:** Research activities that take place in the user's context or personal environment, rather than in an office or lab. 
- **Diary studies:** A research method used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. Often, a user will log, or diary, about their daily activities and provide information about their behaviors and needs, which can help inform your designs. 

**Design research** is done while you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the needs of users, and to reduce risk. Each time you create a new version of your design, new research should be done to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed. 

In design research, your goal is to answer the question: How should we build it?

The amount of design research you conduct will vary depending on where you work and what you’re building. The most common method used to conduct design research is a usability study, which is a technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users. The goal of **usability studies** is to identify pain points that the user experiences with your prototypes, so the issues can be fixed before the product launches. You’ll conduct your own usability study in the next course of this certificate program. 

Additional research methods that might be used to conduct design research include:

- **A/B testing:** A research method that evaluates and compares two different aspects of a product to discover which of them is most effective. For example, you might have users evaluate two layouts for the homepage of your app to find out which layout is more effective. 
- **Cafe or guerrilla studies:** A research method where user feedback is gathered by taking a design or prototype into the public domain and asking passersby for their thoughts. For example, you might sit in a local coffee shop and ask customers if they would be willing to test your app design for a couple of minutes and provide feedback. 
- **Card sorting:** A research method that instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them. This type of research is largely used to figure out the information architecture of your project, which we’ll discuss in the next course of the program — Course 3: Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Designs.
- **Intercepts:** A research method that gathers on-site feedback from users as they engage in the activities being researched. Intercepts are often conducted in the field, so this type of research is often considered a subset of field research. An intercept study can provide quick, high-level feedback.

**Post-launch research** is done after the design is complete and your product has launched. Within the product development life cycle, post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five) to help validate that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.

In post-launch research, your goal is to answer the question: Did we succeed? This research will tell you how your final product is performing based on established metrics, such as adoption, usage, user satisfaction, and more. 

You should use research methods that give insight into what the user thinks of your product and if their experience using your product aligns with how you intended it to function. Research methods you might use to conduct post-launch research include:

- A/B testing
- Usability studies
- Surveys
- Logs analysis: A research method used to evaluate recordings of users while they interact with your design, tools, etc. 

##### The key to a user-focused product: Research

Research is crucial to creating a product that satisfies users. As an entry-level designer, it might be tempting to assume what the user needs based on your own experience, but as you know: The user comes first. Always make sure that your opinions are backed up by your research. You should get feedback from your users before, during, and after you design!

### Choose the right research method

Methods 
The term methods refers to how you get the research done.

Primary research
Primary research is research you conduct yourself.

Secondary research
Secondary research is research that uses information someone else has put together.

Quantitative research
Quantitative research focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring.

qualitative research
qualitative research focuses on observations.

Here's a quick way to remember the difference. Quantitative research gives you the "what" and qualitative research gives you the "why."

Interviews
Interviews are research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings.

Surveys
Surveys are an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.

Usability studies
Usability studies are a technique that help us evaluate a product by testing it on users.

Key performance indicators (KPI)
Key performance indicators are critical measures of progress toward an end goal.

### Reading: Learn more about research methods 

Understanding your users is one of the most essential parts of UX design. You’ve already learned about the problems that can come up when designers make assumptions about their users and their needs. So how do you avoid making those assumptions? By doing research! In this reading, you’ll explore some common research methods used by UX designers.

##### Types of research

There are two ways to categorize research: who conducts the research and the type of data collected. The first way to categorize research is based on who conducts the research. This is called primary research and secondary research.

**Primary research** is research you conduct yourself. Information from direct interactions with users, like interviews, surveys, or usability studies, are considered primary research.

**Secondary research** is research that uses information someone else has put together. For example, using information from sources like books, articles, or journals is considered secondary research.

The second way to categorize research is based on the type of data collected: qualitative or quantitative.

**Qualitative research** is primarily collected through observations and conversations. Qualitative research is based on understanding users’ needs and aims to answer questions like “why” or “how did this happen?”

**Quantitative research** focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring. Quantitative research is based on numerical data that’s often collected from large-scale surveys. This type of research aims to answer questions like “how many?” and “how much?”

All four of these types of research can intermix. Primary and secondary research can be both qualitative and quantitative. For example, an interview is qualitative research. An interview conducted by you is primary research. If you review an article about an interview conducted by someone else, it’s secondary research. It’s important to be able to identify the difference between these types of research because the data you collect forms the basis of your design decisions. 

#### Primary research methods

Now that you understand the different types of research, let’s review some common primary research methods for gathering information.

#### Interviews

**Interviews** are a research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. Interviews can be performed one-on-one or in a group setting, like a focus group. 

Interviews can take the form of qualitative and quantitative research. A qualitative research method includes open-ended questions that require participants to explain their answers by providing more details. A quantitative research method includes only close-ended questions, like questions that require only “yes”  or “no” responses or set multiple choice questions. 

Best practice is to conduct at least five user interviews during your research. As you conduct your interviews, you’ll start to find similarities in the feedback that users provide about what works and what doesn’t work about your product. This is exactly the kind of feedback you want! 

#### Advantages of interviews

- You’re better able to understand what a user thinks and why.
- You can adjust your questions or refocus the discussion based on the user’s answers.
- You have the ability to ask follow-up questions in real time.
- You have the ability to ask questions specific to a user’s needs.
- You’ll receive direct suggestions from the user. 

#### Disadvantages of interviews

- It’s time-consuming to interview each user. 
- It’s expensive to pay participants and to rent space for the interviews.
- The sample sizes are smaller, due to time and money constraints.
- Group interviews can be affected by the bandwagon effect, or going along with the group’s opinion instead of thinking creatively, which can discourage open discussion by people who have an opinion that doesn’t align with the majority of the group. 

If you want to learn more about interviews, check out an article about user interviews from the Nielsen Norman Group.

#### Surveys

A **survey** is an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product. Surveys are a great way to measure the success of your product, during development and after it’s launched. For example, sending surveys after a product is released can help you measure the effectiveness of your product and provide a foundation for future improvements. 

You can design surveys to include open-ended questions for qualitative research, which allow research participants to clarify their survey responses, as well as close-ended questions for quantitative research, which generate numerical data. 

#### Advantages

- You can learn more from a larger sample size.
- You are able to gather results and insights quickly. 
- Surveys are usually inexpensive because they don’t take as much time for participants to complete, and they can be done remotely. 

#### Disadvantages

- Surveys often do not allow for in-depth feedback; most questions will have responses drawn from a set of multiple-choice answers. 
- There are some types of research questions that won’t work in a survey format.
- Surveys usually do not allow for personalization.

If you want to learn more about surveys, check out usability.gov's article about online surveys. 

#### Usability studies

A **usability study** is a technique used to evaluate a product by testing it on users. Usability studies help demonstrate if a product is on the right track or if the design needs to be adjusted. There are lots of ways to test usability, both in person and online. It’s a good idea to record your usability sessions, either audio or video, so you can reference the user data as you make design decisions later on in the process. 

Qualitative research is based on observations, and a critical part of conducting usability studies is observing how participants interact with the product you’ve designed. Focusing on qualitative research during usability studies can generate more personal insights by assessing the behavior of users as they experience the product. Quantitative research can also be used when conducting usability studies to understand participants’ impressions of the product.

#### Advantages 

- You can learn from first-hand user interaction and observation. 
- Usability studies can challenge your assumptions about your product by demonstrating a completely different result than you were expecting. 
- Users can provide in-depth feedback. 

#### Disadvantages

- Usability studies only measures how easy it is to use a product.
- This type of research can be expensive, especially if it’s conducted in person. 
- There can be differences between a “controlled” usability study in a lab versus how a user experiences the product in their real life. 
- If you want to learn more about usability tests, check out the Nielsen Norman Group's article on usability testing.

#### Secondary research methods

**Secondary research** can be completed at any phase of the project, since you’re using information from outside sources. In other words, secondary research is not a direct result of your product or the user you’re designing for. The information you discover during secondary research might lay a foundation for your primary research, so you have a better idea of where to focus your efforts. Or, secondary research might supplement the findings from your primary research for a project, to reiterate or strengthen your conclusions.

#### Advantages

- Secondary research is generally cheaper and faster than primary research. This means you’ll save time and money. 
- You can often find secondary research via online searches and subscription research publications.
- Secondary research can be a good supplement to findings from your primary research.

#### Disadvantages

- You will not learn from any first-hand user interaction.
- You will not receive user feedback specific to your product.
- Secondary research can be misleading and generalizing if not done appropriately. 

If you want to learn more about secondary research, check out an article about secondary research from Formplus.

#### Research in practice
As you move forward in your UX design career, you’ll likely get to experience using several different types of research methods. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and when to use each, can make your research more effective and can improve your product’s design.

### Identify types of bias in UX research

six kinds of biases: 
- confirmation bias
- false consensus bias
- primacy bias
- recency bias
- implicit bias 
- the sunk cost fallacy

##### Bias
a bias is favoring or having prejudice against something based on limited information.

##### Confirmation bias 
This bias occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have.

One of the most effective methods for **overcoming confirmation bias** during research is to ask open-ended questions when conducting interviews. 

An open-ended question lets the person being interviewed answer freely, instead of with a yes or no. You also want to get into the habit of actively listening without adding your own opinions.

Another way to avoid confirmation bias is to include a large sample of users.

##### False consensus bias
In UX research, the false consensus bias happens when we overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design, which creates a false consensus.

**Avoid false consensus bias** by identifying and articulating your assumptions.


That's when it's easiest to remember the last thing you heard in an interview, conversation, or similar setting, because it's the most recent.

##### Recency bias 

That's when it's easiest to remember the last thing you heard in an interview, conversation, or similar setting, because it's the most recent. When talking to someone, you're more likely to remember things they shared at the end of the conversation.

##### Primacy bias

where you remember the first participant most strongly. Sometimes the first person you meet makes the strongest impression, because you're in a new situation or having a new experience. The primacy bias, like the recency bias, is another reason to take detailed notes or recordings, so you can review everything that happened, not just the memorable first impressions. 

##### *Overcoming recency & primacy bias* 
Recency and primacy biases also demonstrate why you should interview each participant in the same way.


##### Implicit bias
Implicit bias is a collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge.

***Overcoming Implicit bias***
To overcome our biases, we can reflect on our behaviors, and we can ask others to point our implicit biases.


##### The sunk cost fallacy
This is the idea that the deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course without feeling like we've failed or wasted time.

To avoid the sunk cost fallacy, break down your project into smaller phases, and then outline designated points where you can decide whether to continue or stop. This allows you to go back based on new insights before the project gets too far along.

### Reading: Learn more about bias in UX research

The human brain is an incredible processing machine, and it can store an amazing amount of information. One way brains are able to store so much information is by creating mental shortcuts based on repeated patterns. These shortcuts allow humans to relate and group information together for quicker processing. But, these repeated patterns of thinking can lead to inaccurate or unreasonable conclusions that are biased — favoring or having prejudice against someone or something. Biases can seriously impact your user research and negatively influence the design of your final product. So, let’s explore how bias can affect your work as a UX designer and how to combat it during your research. 

#### Preventing bias in data collection
It’s important to note that everyone has biases. It’s just a natural part of being human. Being able to recognize your own biases and prevent them from affecting your work is what really matters. As a UX designer, you’ll need to know how to anticipate, identify, and overcome biases in your research, in particular.

**Choose your words carefully**. While conducting research, it’s important to use words that don’t lead the user in one direction or another. Of course, as a designer, you’re going to be partial to the designs you’ve created, and you’ll likely assume that users will appreciate them too. That’s why you designed them! But when asking users questions about their experience using your product, you don’t want them to answer in a particular way just to please you. Choosing leading words can cause the **framing effect**, where users make a decision or choice based on the way information was presented to them. 

This is especially critical in usability studies. For example, imagine a participant is testing your designs. You ask the participant: “Do you like or dislike the improved layout of these buttons?” Because you used the word “improved,” the user will most likely reply positively. But, this isn’t very useful feedback because you framed the question in a way that led the participant to respond accordingly. To improve your product, you need honest feedback.

Instead, a better way to frame the same question is: “Explain how you feel about the layout of the buttons.” This phrasing allows the user to come to their own conclusions without any outside influence, which will give you better data about their thought process and experience. 

**Foster independent thinking**. Group interviews can be affected by the **bandwagon effect**, or going along with the group’s opinion instead of thinking creatively, which can discourage open discussion by people who have an opinion that doesn’t align with the majority of the group. 

For example, imagine you’re conducting research with a group of five participants. You ask each person in the group to share their thoughts one at a time about a particular product design choice, like the placement of a button on the home page. By the time the last person shares their thoughts, their feedback will be affected by all of the answers that were shared before them. To combat the bandwagon effect, ask participants to write down or record their thoughts before discussing as a group.

**Avoid specific language**. It’s important to be mindful about the types of questions you ask users and how those questions are framed. You’ll need to be careful to avoid confirmation bias, which is trying to find evidence to prove a hypothesis you already have. 

Confirmation bias is particularly prevalent in online surveys. For example, imagine that you’re conducting an online survey with a large group of participants. One of your survey questions is: “How do you use our product?” As the designer, you have a few ideas about how you think people use your product, so you provide four options with specifically worded language that the participant has to choose from. If none of the options you’ve provided apply to the user, they can’t select “other” or skip the question, so they’ll be forced to choose one of the multiple-choice answers that doesn’t match their actual experience. That means you’ll end up with false information that skews your research data and potentially provides incorrect evidence for a hypothesis you already had. 

Remember, in a survey, you want measurable results, which is known as quantitative data. You can reframe the question in your survey to ask participants to rate their experiences using the product, which will be a more accurate way to gauge how they felt about using it.


**Limit the guidance you give users**. Everyone learns and thinks in different ways. When you’re conducting any type of UX research, you have to be cautious to avoid experiencing any false consensus, which is the assumption that others will think the same way as you do. 

If you’re conducting a usability study, some of the participants will not follow the product’s user flow in the way that you might expect. For example, a user might click through the menu, select a folder, and then select a subfolder to complete a task you assigned them, when there’s actually a simple hyperlink on the homepage that could have saved them time. In addition, some participants may use assistive technology to navigate the product and might follow an entirely different flow. 

It’s important to let participants follow their own paths through your product, without interrupting them. Interrupting a participant while they’re experiencing your product will deprive you of useful data that can help you understand how to improve your designs. Instead, ask participants to narrate or break down their user journey with your product, as they move through the flow. This will allow you to better understand their thought process as they navigate through your designs. 

**Consider users’ tone and body language.** You’ll work with many different users and participants throughout your UX career, and part of your job will involve interpreting their nonverbal cues, like vocal tone and body language. To avoid experiencing **implicit biases**, which are based on the collection of attitudes and stereotypes you associate with people without your conscious knowledge, it’s important to clarify when you think you’re getting mixed signals from a participant. 

For example, imagine you’re conducting a one-on-one interview, and the participant has their arms crossed over their chest. This can be interpreted as a sign of feeling defensive or insecure, which might contradict the positive feedback they are sharing verbally about your product. This is a great time to ask the participant questions, like “Is any of this making you uncomfortable?”, which can encourage them to explain that it’s cold in your office and they’re just trying to warm themselves up. Always ask questions if you’re unsure about the intention of a user’s tone or body language! 

For this feedback process to work, however, it’s important to make sure participants are comfortable sharing their thoughts with you. Before the research begins, ask participants about themselves or make light conversation. Starting with easier questions can help reduce anxiety or awkwardness throughout the study. 

**Be careful of your own body language and reactions.** You also have to be mindful of your own tone and body language while interacting with participants. **Social desirability bias** can happen when a participant answers a question based on what they think you want to hear. If you ask a question to a participant, and they notice you exhibiting a visual or audible clue that suggests your own opinion about the question, they might answer in a way that they think will please you. 

For example, imagine you’re describing a feature of the app you’ve designed that really excites you, and your tone of voice changes. If this happens, it’s likely that the participant won’t be honest about their negative opinions of the feature, since you’re so positive about it. If you want the data you collect to be useful, the user has to feel comfortable sharing their true, unfiltered feelings about the product. It’s your job to guide them through the process without accidentally influencing their answers. One way to do this is to reassure participants that their answers won’t hurt anyone’s feelings and that you really want to hear their honest opinions in order to improve your work. 

**Plan your research effectively.** Tight deadlines are inevitable. But as a UX designer, it’s essential you get enough time to recruit the right users for your research. **Availability bias** occurs when you rush the user recruitment process or skip screener questions to attract a bigger pool of users, even if they don’t fit the qualifications or characteristics that you’ve already determined are present in your ideal user. 

The research that you collect is vital to your product design process. So interviewing users that don’t fall under your personas won’t give you the data you need to improve your designs. If you’re having trouble recruiting the right users before your deadline, offer a better incentive for participating in your study, adjust your recruitment strategy, or ask your project manager for more time. Don’t just take any user who’s available. 

**Remain open minded.** One more tip: When you’re conducting research, you have to work hard to treat all information equally to avoid both **primacy bias**, which is remembering the first user more than others, and **recency bias**, which is most easily remembering the last thing you heard. To help combat these biases in your own research, it’s helpful to space out the scheduling of interviews, ask your colleagues to join you during interviews to provide additional opinions, and take careful notes. 

#### Combating bias as a UX designer
Although having biases is normal, it’s essential to try to eliminate bias from your research process to get the most accurate understanding of your users’ needs. Knowing the types of biases that exist and how you can avoid them will help you recognize when it’s happening, so you’re already off to a great start!

### Recruit interview participants

As you start to think about conducting interviews for UX research, you might be wondering: How can I find and recruit people who want to be interviewed? Well, this reading will guide you through just that!

#### Determine interview goals 

You want to ensure that the interviews you conduct are worthwhile, both for you and for the participants. To make the most of your time together, you need to determine clear goals for the interview. As a UX designer, what do you want to learn from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? 

Here are some examples of common research goals when it comes to empathizing with users: 

- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
- I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing. 

#### Write interview questions

With the goals of the interview in mind, you can write the questions that you’ll ask real people during interviews. The more aligned the interview questions are with your goals, the more useful the data you obtain will be. 

There are a few best practices to keep in mind when writing interview questions:

- **Ask open-ended questions.** Open-ended questions allow the person being interviewed to answer freely, instead of with a simple “yes” or “no.” For example, if you’re designing an app to help people find dog walkers, you should ask “Could you describe your experience with finding and scheduling dog walkers?” instead of “Have you ever used an app to find a dog walker?”. Keep in mind that the questions you ask during interviews should not lead or pressure participants towards a desired response; instead, asking open-ended questions lets participants share their true thoughts and perspectives.
- **Keep questions short and simple.** It should be easy for interview participants to understand what you’re asking. 
- **Ask follow-up questions.** During the empathize phase of the design process, interviews should be conversational, so encouraging participants to elaborate is a best practice. After a participant answers an interview question, try asking them “Why?” or use the phrase, “Tell me more about that” to keep the conversation flowing.

#### Use a screener to select a representative sample of study participants 

It’s important to recognize that asking demographic questions can be a sensitive and challenging space to navigate. Be conscious and mindful of the questions you ask in screener surveys and how you ask them. Frame questions in a way that is respectful and inclusive, and make questions optional if they ask about demographic data. You might want to preface demographic questions with a short explanation of why the question is being asked. For example, “In the spirit of inclusive design, we are asking these questions to make sure we’re reaching out to a diverse group of people.”

Interviewing participants with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities is extremely important to ensure that your designs are accessible and equitable. A **representative sample** is a small group of participants who represent both the target user group and user groups that are often marginalized. Interviewing a representative sample will help you improve the overall user experience of your product because inclusive design benefits everyone. Ultimately, the research you conduct should help you create great experiences for all users!  

##### Find research participants

At this point, you’ve determined the goals of the interview, written interview questions, and created a screener survey to find a representative sample of study participants. You’re ready to start recruiting participants! 

How and where you find research study participants depends on the company you work for, the type of product you’re designing, time constraints for the research, the project’s budget, and the accessibility of target users. Based on these project details, you can choose from a variety of ways to find research participants. 

- **Personal network.** As a UX designer in training, your personal network is a great way to find people to interview! Think about family, friends, or colleagues who fit the demographics of the target users you’re designing for.
- **Existing user base.** If you’re conducting research and creating designs for an organization with an existing user base, you’ll likely be able to recruit participants from that group of established connections. This might not be the case for your current project in this program, but recruiting from an existing user base is pretty common in the real world. 
- **Online.** Alternatively, if you’re coming up with designs for an imaginary company or a newly established business, the easiest way to recruit participants for your study is online. You can use your own social media to find research participants. Or, there are websites created specifically to connect with research participants, like UserTesting and User Interviews. You can also find online groups that have users with the demographic characteristics that you want to interview. For example, if you’re designing an app for parents, you might find an online group about parenting. Before you post in an online community, make sure to check group rules or ask an administrator for permission to ask for research participation!
- **Hallway testing.** If recruiting participants online doesn’t seem like an option, a less formal way to recruit for your study is to ask people in person. You can use a recruiting method known as hallway testing, which means asking people that pass by in the “hallway” to try the product you’re designing. Try to position yourself in a location where you’re most likely to encounter your product’s target audience, like a dog park or a coffee shop. Hallway testing can be effective if you’re recruiting a small number of participants, if you have limited time, or if you want to conduct research for free. However, finding participants in this way is risky because the people you collect feedback from might not have all the characteristics of your product’s potential users.
- **Third-party recruiting agencies.** Some organizations have a budget to hire third-party research recruiting agencies. Recruiting agencies are useful because they save you time and can often reach diverse users.  

##### Reach out to participants

Once you’ve identified potential research participants, send an email that introduces the project and yourself as the researcher. If you have the budget to provide an incentive to motivate or encourage people to participate in a research study, like a gift card, include that in the email, too.

Here’s an example of an email that could be sent to potential research participants:


>Hello [Participant Name],
>
>I am currently working on a project for a certificate program where I need to conduct interviews about [explain the project]. 
>
>Your participation in the research study would be very valuable to help us [summary of project goals]. Details of the study are shared below. 
>
>Location: [Address and link to map]
>Study dates: [Date range]
>Time: [Time range]
>Session length: [Estimated length of time for each interview]
>With your permission, we will record each interview to help us decide how to improve our product. Recordings will only be shared with project team members for the scope of this project. A consent form is attached to this email that you need to sign and send back. 
>
>If you have any questions, please contact me through email at [your email address]. 
>
>If you are interested in being interviewed, please let me know when you are available between [date range of study] and the hours of [time range of study].
>
>Sincerely,
>
>[Your Name]

Research is an essential part of the UX design process and empathizing with users. Taking time to outline the goals for your research and recruit a representative sample of participants will help ensure the feedback you obtain is valuable. Good luck recruiting!

### Build an empathy map from an interview transcript

To empathize with users, UX designers and researchers often conduct interviews. Interviews can help you understand users’ perspectives and learn their pain points. But interviewing users is only the beginning of the UX research process! While interviews provide a lot of insight, empathy mapping will bring you closer to identifying the real needs of your users. 

Remember, **empathy maps** are easily understood charts that explain everything UX designers have learned about a particular type of user. Empathy maps break down each interview into digestible pieces of information.

In this reading, you'll learn about **one-user empathy maps**, which are empathy maps that are created by taking one user's interview transcript and turning it into an empathy map.

##### Empathy mapping in action

Imagine your company is building a new app for scheduling dog walkers. The purpose of the app is to match qualified dog walkers with customers who need help caring for their dogs, similar to a ride-sharing or home-sharing app. You’re on the UX team, and your team is in the early stages of designing the app and understanding user pain points. 

A colleague has already interviewed dog owners and professional dog walkers who are expected to use the app regularly. It’s now your responsibility to summarize each interview transcript. An interview transcript is a typed or written version of a conversation that’s been recorded. Your job is to summarize the transcripts using empathy maps and present the maps to the rest of your team.

Check out this example of an interview transcript with Makayla, a fourth-grade teacher with two dogs. You can read the entire transcript below, or you can reference this document if you want the interview transcript in a separate window to follow along as you complete the rest of the reading.

#### Interview transcript

Name: Makayla Scott

Situation: Makayla is a 45-year-old, female-identifying teacher who lives in Houston, Texas. She has two dogs. Makayla has a demanding job as a fourth grade teacher. She also volunteers as a volleyball coach after school. Makayla’s partner works full-time as a pediatric surgeon and regularly switches between working the night-shift and the day-shift at a local hospital.  

**[UX Researcher]** Can you describe your current work situation and how you take care of your dogs? 

**[Makayla]** I work as a teacher, and I coach volleyball after school, so my puppers Reggie and Snowball are often left home alone for long periods of time. My partner works on-call in a hospital, which often means 12-hour day or night shifts. When our schedules overlap, we definitely need help walking Reggie and Snowball.

**[UXR]** What challenges do you face managing the care of your dogs? How does this make you feel?

**[Makayla]** I love my dogs! They have so much energy. If it was up to them, they’d go on five walks a day! But, with our schedules, it’s hard to take them out as much as we’d like. I can manage taking them out first thing in the morning and again in the evening. Sometimes, I pay my next door neighbor’s 17-year-old son to walk them. But, the real issue comes from our travel schedule. My partner and I like to take a lot of trips, and we can’t always take our pets with us. Planning our trips would be much easier if we could book a dog walker. 

Our neighbor’s son is graduating this year, and his schedule is becoming inconsistent. I can’t rely on him at the last minute, and I worry that he doesn’t really have the right experience for when I’m on longer trips. I mean, sure, a 17-year-old kid is fine for daily walks. But what if he takes the dogs for a weekend and Snowball gets sick? How will he know what to do, or if he should call me? It definitely makes me worry, but I can’t spend the money on a doggy daycare.

There are also a lot of places I can’t bring Reggie, who is a much bigger dog than Snowball. He’s not hypoallergenic like Snowball is. And, because he’s so big, even bringing him on road trips can be a struggle. We just moved to Houston last year, and there aren’t many people we can ask for help. I’ve considered putting up an ad online, but I’m not sure how I would know who’s safe to allow in my home or who’s good with dogs.  

**[UXR]** Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved?

**[Makayla]** I’d love to find a dog walker that I could prescreen and learn more about. And I’d love a way to book someone consistently. Maybe someone who can do weekends regularly and can commit to specific times while I’m working. Ideally, I could schedule dog sitting days in advance. I just need a consistent dog walker that I can screen to make sure they’re safe and good with animals! I’m willing to pay a little more to get something like this instead of constantly requesting help from my neighbor. 

#### Creating an empathy map

Now that you’ve had a chance to review Makayla’s interview transcript, let’s break down the steps for creating an empathy map. As a reminder, here’s what an empathy map includes: 

**Step 1: Add the user’s name.** Include the name of the person interviewed in your empathy map. Having a name attached to it will help if you ever need to look back at the original transcript or research, and it’ll distinguish this map from other maps you create.

**Step 2: The “SAYS” square.** Use verbatim quotes from the interview. In other words, write down exactly what the person said; don’t summarize it in your own words. If you summarize a quote, you might accidentally interpret the user’s meaning incorrectly. It’s also helpful to try to capture themes in the interview that relate to the product you’re researching. For example, if the user restates the same problem several times during the interview, then it’s probably a major pain point. Pay special attention to challenges your user states, and record any desired benefits or expectations they mention. 

**Step 3: The “THINKS” square.** Here, you can summarize the thoughts expressed by the user. Add feelings the user conveyed through body language, tone, or other noticeable indicators, even if they didn’t verbally express them to you. You can make inferences for some of these feelings, but you have to be careful not to make assumptions about the user. For example, Makayla expressed concern about her neighbor’s teenage son and mentioned his age and qualifications. An assumption is that Makayla wants an adult dog walker. An inference is that she wants a dog walker with a car and a driver's license who can take the dog to the emergency vet. You can always ask your user for clarification on their body language if you find any contradictions.  

**Step 4: The “DOES” square.** Makayla gave us quite a bit of detail on steps and actions she takes to overcome the dog-walking challenges she faces. All those actions can go in the “DOES” square.

**Step 5: The “FEELS” square.** List the feelings the user expresses. The notes you include may overlap with some of what you listed in the “THINKS” square. That’s okay! This process is meant to be a thorough documentation of your observations. If you’re the person performing the interview, you might notice signs of feelings like anger, frustration, excitement, and others. If the user doesn’t explicitly mention any feelings during the interview, you can probe for feelings with the question: “How does this make you feel?”

#### Empathy map example for Makayla

Now that you’ve reviewed the interview transcript and the steps for creating an empathy map, let’s use our template to take action! Here’s an empathy map for Makayla:

###### SAYS

- “I’m not sure how I would know who’s safe to allow in my home or who’s good with dogs.”
- “I’d love to find a dog walker that I could prescreen.”
- “I’d love a way to book someone consistently.”
- “Ideally, I could schedule dog-sitting days in advance.”
- “...there aren’t many people we can ask for help”
- “I’m willing to pay a little more to get...this”

###### THINKS

- Wants to book recurring dog walkers
- Would like to prescreen dog walkers
- Would like to find dog walkers in advance 
- Dog walking is expensive
- Would like a dog walker who has experience with animals
- Doesn’t know enough people to ask them to walk her dogs 
- Wants a more consistent dog walker

###### DOES 

- Works a full-time job as a teacher
- Walks her dogs first thing in the morning and evening
- Pays her neighbor, a 17-year-old high school student, to -  walk the dogs 

###### FEELS

- Guilty when she can’t take her dogs for walks
- Sad she can’t spend more time with her dogs
- Sad she can’t take her dogs on vacation
- Worried about finding a consistent, dedicated dog walker that can commit to her schedule
- Worried about her larger dog’s needs 
- Worried about her current dog walker’s ability to manage a potential sudden illness in her dog
 

This empathy map breaks down all the points that your team will need to determine how your app can meet Makayla’s needs. The real challenge starts when you lay out the empathy maps from all of your user interviews and figure out how each of your potential users’ needs overlap. 

#### Types of empathy maps

It's important to understand that there are two types of empathy maps: **one-user empathy maps** and **aggregated empathy maps** (also known as "multiple-user empathy maps"). One-user empathy maps are created by taking one user's interview transcript and turning it into an empathy map, like the example earlier in this reading. This approach helps designers distill a single user's thoughts, feelings, and traits into a format that's easier to gather data from. 

The other kind of empathy map, an aggregated empathy map, represents a group of users who share similar thoughts, opinions, or qualities. Aggregated empathy maps are created by creating multiple one-user empathy maps from interview transcripts, then combining the maps where users expressed similar things into a new empathy map. This helps designers identify segments, or groups of people with similar tendencies, who will use the product. The insights in aggregated empathy maps allow designers to identify themes, which helps them better empathize with the groups they are designing for. To learn more about the different kinds of empathy maps, check out this article on empathy mapping from the Nielsen Norman Group. 

You’re beginning to understand what it means to empathize with your users. Each time you interact with a potential user, you get a little closer to understanding their perspectives and pain points. Good luck!
