# Week 2: 
### Craft user stories 

A **user story** is a fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions. It introduces the user, lays out an obstacle, and states their ultimate goal.

AKA User Cases or Scenarios 

Advantages of user stories 
- Prioritize design goals 
- Unite the team 
- inspire empathetic design decisions
- Personalize pitches to stakeholders 

To write a user story, we follow this simple formula. 

    User Story = Hero + Goal + Conflict 

As a type of user, I want to action, so that benefit. All that's left now is filling in the missing pieces. Type of user describes who we are designing for. Action is what the user hopes will happen. And finally, benefit is why the user wants the action to happen. This formula keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear.


       Who              What            Why 
       As a ______, I want to ______, so that ______. 
         type of user         action          benefit

### Reading: Learn More about user stories 

You’ve already learned about empathy maps and personas and how they can help you empathize with the users you’re designing for. Another helpful way to understand your users is to build a user story around their experiences with your product. As a reminder, a **user story** is a fictional one-sentence story told from the persona’s point of view to inspire and inform design decisions. This is a great opportunity to use your imagination as you create the stories that capture the needs of your users.

User stories should be written in the following format:

As a type of user (who), I want to action (what) so that benefit (why).

Using this format is a clear way to ensure your user story is communicating everything you need to know about the persona. The user stories you create will be very valuable as you start designing your product. User stories can also serve as a “checklist” to make sure you’re addressing and solving the key problems your users might face when engaging with your product. 

The best practice for user stories is to keep them short, impactful, and to the point, with a clear action and benefit.

Practice using this format to create user stories related to the dog walker app you've been learning about.

Keeping these user stories in mind can inform the designs you’ll create. For example, in the dog walker app, users should have the ability to request a date and time for a dog walker, select a specific dog walker, and maybe even read the background checks of dog walkers, since those were all mentioned in our user stories. 

Different users have different needs, so be sure to practice empathy and keep their unique needs in mind when writing user stories. To help you write the most effective user stories, check out two articles: one, from Interaction Design Foundation about how to write user stories; and another from TO THE NEW on how to avoid common user story mistakes.

##### Representing your users
Personas and user stories represent the needs of the users you’re designing for. The more detailed and accurate your personas and user stories are, the better you will be at designing products that meet their needs. Take your time when creating user stories. Remember, as a UX designer, the user always comes first in all of your work, so it's important to understand their points.

### Consider edge cases 

##### The happy path
The happy path describes a user story with a happy ending.

##### Edge Cases 
An edge case is what happens when things go wrong that are beyond the user's control.

##### Spotting & resolving edge cases 

- Create personas and user stories
- Thoroughly review the project before launch 
- Use wireframes

### Create a user journey map 


##### Benefits of user journey mapping 
- Helps UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users 
- Reduces impact of designer bias 
- Highlights new pain points 
- Identify improvement opportunities 


##### Step 1 
Add each action in the journey until the user reaches their goal 
##### Step 2
Add descriptions for each action. What tasks does the user have to do? 
##### Step 3
Add how the user feels at each point. Guesstimates are okay. 
##### Step 4 
Add opportunities for improvement. This is where new ideas may come from!
