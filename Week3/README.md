# Week 2: 
### Craft user stories 

A **user story** is a fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions. It introduces the user, lays out an obstacle, and states their ultimate goal.

AKA User Cases or Scenarios 

Advantages of user stories 
- Prioritize design goals 
- Unite the team 
- inspire empathetic design decisions
- Personalize pitches to stakeholders 

To write a user story, we follow this simple formula. 

    User Story = Hero + Goal + Conflict 

As a type of user, I want to action, so that benefit. All that's left now is filling in the missing pieces. Type of user describes who we are designing for. Action is what the user hopes will happen. And finally, benefit is why the user wants the action to happen. This formula keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear.


       Who              What            Why 
       As a ______, I want to ______, so that ______. 
         type of user         action          benefit
