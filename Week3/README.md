# Week 2: 
### Craft user stories 

A **user story** is a fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions. It introduces the user, lays out an obstacle, and states their ultimate goal.

AKA User Cases or Scenarios 

Advantages of user stories 
- Prioritize design goals 
- Unite the team 
- inspire empathetic design decisions
- Personalize pitches to stakeholders 

To write a user story, we follow this simple formula. 

    User Story = Hero + Goal + Conflict 

As a type of user, I want to action, so that benefit. All that's left now is filling in the missing pieces. Type of user describes who we are designing for. Action is what the user hopes will happen. And finally, benefit is why the user wants the action to happen. This formula keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear.


       Who              What            Why 
       As a ______, I want to ______, so that ______. 
         type of user         action          benefit

### Reading: Learn More about user stories 

You’ve already learned about empathy maps and personas and how they can help you empathize with the users you’re designing for. Another helpful way to understand your users is to build a user story around their experiences with your product. As a reminder, a **user story** is a fictional one-sentence story told from the persona’s point of view to inspire and inform design decisions. This is a great opportunity to use your imagination as you create the stories that capture the needs of your users.

User stories should be written in the following format:

![](/Week3/week3images/format.png)

As a type of user (who), I want to action (what) so that benefit (why).

Using this format is a clear way to ensure your user story is communicating everything you need to know about the persona. The user stories you create will be very valuable as you start designing your product. User stories can also serve as a “checklist” to make sure you’re addressing and solving the key problems your users might face when engaging with your product. 

The best practice for user stories is to keep them short, impactful, and to the point, with a clear action and benefit.

Practice using this format to create user stories related to the dog walker app you've been learning about.

Keeping these user stories in mind can inform the designs you’ll create. For example, in the dog walker app, users should have the ability to request a date and time for a dog walker, select a specific dog walker, and maybe even read the background checks of dog walkers, since those were all mentioned in our user stories. 

Different users have different needs, so be sure to practice empathy and keep their unique needs in mind when writing user stories. To help you write the most effective user stories, check out two articles: one, from Interaction Design Foundation about how to write user stories; and another from TO THE NEW on how to avoid common user story mistakes.

##### Representing your users
Personas and user stories represent the needs of the users you’re designing for. The more detailed and accurate your personas and user stories are, the better you will be at designing products that meet their needs. Take your time when creating user stories. Remember, as a UX designer, the user always comes first in all of your work, so it's important to understand their points.

### Consider edge cases 

##### The happy path
The happy path describes a user story with a happy ending.

##### Edge Cases 
An edge case is what happens when things go wrong that are beyond the user's control.

##### Spotting & resolving edge cases 

- Create personas and user stories
- Thoroughly review the project before launch 
- Use wireframes

### Create a user journey map 


##### Benefits of user journey mapping 
- Helps UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users 
- Reduces impact of designer bias 
- Highlights new pain points 
- Identify improvement opportunities 


##### Step 1 
Add each action in the journey until the user reaches their goal 
##### Step 2
Add descriptions for each action. What tasks does the user have to do? 
##### Step 3
Add how the user feels at each point. Guesstimates are okay. 
##### Step 4 
Add opportunities for improvement. This is where new ideas may come from!

### Consider accessibility 

#### Reading: Consider accessibility when creating personas, user stories, and user journey maps

**Accessibility** is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. Designing for accessibility is about considering all users’ journeys, keeping their permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities in mind. By researching how people with disabilities interact with products like yours, you can better understand how to design for them. It’s not possible to accurately guess all the ways that a user might experience your product, which is one reason why including people with disabilities in your research is so important. 

Here are a few considerations for you to take into account when conducting research during the empathize phase of the design process.

**Touch:** How would you design for users who have use of one arm, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?

- Decide where to place buttons within your design based on several different hand sizes.
- Create a feature that allows double taps to avoid accidental icon clicks.
- Enable the one-handed keyboard feature and general keyboard compatibility.
- Allow button customization for easy access to information that the user finds most important.

**See:** How would you design for users who have limited vision, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?

- Use a larger font to create a reader-friendly design of the app.
- Ensure the app and the images have alternate text that can be read by a screen reader.
- Detect whether the user is operating a motor vehicle.
- Design the app with high contrast colors.
- Don’t rely on text color to explain navigation or next steps. For example, don’t use red text alone as an indicator of a warning. Instead, your design should include explicit instructions.

**Hear:** How would you design for users who have limited hearing, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 

- Don’t rely solely on sounds to provide app updates, like a new message notification. Instead, enable haptics, which are vibrations that engage a user’s sense of touch, and notification lights.
- Apply closed captioning to all videos. 
- Provide a text messaging system within the app to allow users to communicate through writing.

**Speak:** How would you design for users who cannot speak, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 

- Provide written intros, descriptions, and instructions for users, in addition to video-based content.
- Provide Real-Time Texting during phone calls with users or with app support.
- Arrange alternatives for automated systems that rely on speech recognition.
- Provide an in-app messaging system that allows the use of emojis and image uploads.
This list is just a small fraction of the considerations you should take into account when designing for users with disabilities. The best way to learn about how to improve your designs is to conduct research and get feedback from people with disabilities directly.

#### Assistive technologies

Creating a product design that takes every range of ability into account can be incredibly difficult. Thankfully, there are services and apps designed to help bridge the gap. For example, one service that’s recently been added by phone providers is Real-Time Texting, which lets users text during a phone call to improve communication. 

Another feature that helps people with disabilities is alternative text. People who have low vision or are blind often rely on screen readers to read the content on their screens aloud. But, if your informational icons don’t have labels or alternative text, the screen reader can’t describe the functionality of that button to the user. Not every image or icon is informational, so only include descriptions when necessary. 

Researching and learning about assistive technology will help you better understand the impact these technologies have. Here are a few links to help you get started:

#### Putting inclusive design into practice

To put inclusive design into practice, it’s important to immerse yourself in the assistive technology that people with disabilities might use and to have conversations with them about their experiences. The best way to design empathetically for the world around you is to engage with your users and ask them questions about the way your designs could help them succeed.

#### Understand the curb cut effect 

##### Curb cut 
A curb cut is the name for the slope of the sidewalk that creates a ramp with the adjoining street. Curb cuts are usually found at intersections.

##### Curb cut effect
The curb-cut effect is a phenomenon that describes how products and policies designed for people with disabilities often end up helping everyone.
