You’ve empathized with your users and determined their pain points. Now you’re ready to start thinking of ways to solve your user’s problems. Ideating is an exciting step in your journey as a UX designer! 

As a reminder, design ideation is the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic without judging or evaluating them. When you start thinking of ideas, you want to come up with as many as possible. The aim is to generate lots of ideas, even ones that may seem ridiculous at first. Sometimes your most outrageous idea will turn into a great and unique solution!

##### Preparing for ideation
Before you start design ideation, you’ll need to do a bit of prep work.

**Empathize with your user.** Empathizing is the first step in the design process. You need to know who you’re solving for and what their needs are. You empathized with your user already by creating empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps. 

**Define the problem.** Defining is the second step in the design process. The problem you’re trying to solve should be well-defined, so that everyone on your team can think of ideas to solve the same problem. Knowing exactly what problem you need to solve will also keep your users’ needs top-of-mind.

**Establish a creative environment.** You’ll need a comfortable space where everyone on your team can get together and present their ideas. If you’re meeting in person, choose an ideation space that’s different from your usual workspace. If you’re ideating virtually, try to find a different space in your home that’s free of clutter and distractions.

**Set a time limit.** There are an endless number of possible products and features you could design, so give yourself plenty of time to come up with ideas. However, you can’t brainstorm forever, so you’ll also need to set a time to stop brainstorming and start thinking more deeply about the ideas you’ve come up with.

**Assemble a diverse team.** You’re trying to come up with as many different ideas as possible. An inclusive team of people, with different races, genders, abilities, and backgrounds, will help you come up with all kinds of solutions.

**Think outside the box.** Don’t limit yourself to traditional ideas and solutions. If you have a cool idea that seems a little different, write it down! Think big and get creative while ideating. 

There’s no right or wrong way to practice design ideation. There are many techniques you can use to come up with ideas. If you want to learn more, check out this article from CareerFoundry, A Guide To The Most Important Ideation Techniques, which highlights some common design ideation techniques. Once you start ideating for your own projects, you may even come up with your own version of one of these techniques!

##### The importance of design ideation

While design ideation can take a significant amount of time, it's also a lot of fun! You’ll generate many possible solutions, and you’ll end up using one, or a few, of your original ideas. This is perfectly normal in the UX design process, and it’s an exciting part of the working with a team. Narrowing down many ideas to a couple of great ones is very rewarding.

Design ideation encourages you to come up with solutions that are unique. Don’t settle for your first solution. In fact, the first few solutions you suggest are often the least creative because they’re the most obvious. When generating ideas, you should use your creative powers to their full potential.

Following the design process outlined in this certificate program will lay the foundation for your product’s design. The more effort you put into empathizing with your users, defining the problems they’re facing, and coming up with ideas for solutions, the better your end result will be.

### Explore lots of ideas

##### Why should we come up with a lot of ideas? 

- List of ideas is narrowed based on constraints 
- Need to focus on equity 
- Let users test the ideas

### Scope the competition 
##### Competitive audit
A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors' strengths and weaknesses.

##### What you can learn from a competitive audit.
- Identifying your key competitors 
- Reviewing the products that your competitors offer
- Understanding how your competitors position themselves in the market 
- Examining what your competition does well and what they could do better 
- Considering how your competitors talk about themselves 

##### Benefits to competitive audits 

- Inform your design process
- Solve usability problem 
- Reveal gaps in the market 
- Provide reliable evidence 
- Save time, money, and energy 

**Direct competitors** have offerings, meaning products, services, or features, that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience.

Indirect competitors are a little more nuanced. They either have a similar set of offerings, but focus on a different audience than you, or they have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience as you.

### Reading: Learn more about competitive audits

Competitive audits are one of the many valuable steps you can take during the ideation process. A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. Analyzing the brands and products of competitors, or the companies who offer similar products as you do, can give you a well-rounded foundation of knowledge about the market your product will enter. That knowledge will carry into your designs and help you create a product that’s helpful and unique for users. As a UX designer, you’ll likely partner with folks from other teams, like marketing or product management, to run a competitive audit. 

Your competition falls into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct competitors are companies that have offerings similar to your product and focus on the same audience. Indirect competitors can have a similar set of offerings and a different audience, or a different set of offerings with the same audience. Examining both of these competitors can offer insights about the path your designs might take and the users that you’re designing for. 

##### Why are competitive audits important?

Consider how much work your direct and indirect competitors have already done to design and market their products to users. They’ve already had an impact on the industry that your product will enter. Studying these companies, their designs, and their user feedback is a fantastic source of information. 

Competitive audits can offer many benefits throughout your ideation phase, including:

- Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their designs. 
- Suggesting ideas to solve early problems that you’re facing with your own designs. 
- Revealing the ways that current products in the market are not meeting users’ needs. This is a gap for your product to address!
- Demonstrating the expected life cycle of a product in the same market as yours.
- Informing all the different iterations your product could take and how those performed for your competitors. 

With these benefits in mind, you can work with your team to identify the features and qualifications that you think are vital to your product. You'll focus your audit on the parts of your own design that you want to learn the most about, like the user flow through your app or the navigation within the app. A little self-reflection about the designs you're working on will set up your audit for success from the start. 

By investing time into competitive audits, your team will be able to learn from the mistakes of your competitors and can avoid making those mistakes yourselves. Think of audits as a tool to help you create something for your users that’s completely different from the competition, combing all of the strengths of your competitors’ offerings into one fantastic product!
