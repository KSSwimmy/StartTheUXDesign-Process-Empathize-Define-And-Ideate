# WEEK 5: 

### Understand design ideation

##### Ideation 
Ideation can be defined as the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic with no attempt to judge or evaluate them.

##### Ideation in the real world 

- Brainstorm out loud 
- Document all ideas 
- Focus on quantity 
- Do not allow evaluation
- Gather a diverse team 
- Question the obvious 
- Evaluate the ideas 

##### Common ways to evaluate your ideas.

- Feasible: Technically possible to bulid 
- Desirable: Best at solving the user problem 
- Viable: Financially beneficial for the business

### Reading: Learn more about design ideation

You’ve empathized with your users and determined their pain points. Now you’re ready to start thinking of ways to solve your user’s problems. Ideating is an exciting step in your journey as a UX designer! 

As a reminder, design ideation is the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic without judging or evaluating them. When you start thinking of ideas, you want to come up with as many as possible. The aim is to generate lots of ideas, even ones that may seem ridiculous at first. Sometimes your most outrageous idea will turn into a great and unique solution!

##### Preparing for ideation
Before you start design ideation, you’ll need to do a bit of prep work.

**Empathize with your user.** Empathizing is the first step in the design process. You need to know who you’re solving for and what their needs are. You empathized with your user already by creating empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps. 

**Define the problem.** Defining is the second step in the design process. The problem you’re trying to solve should be well-defined, so that everyone on your team can think of ideas to solve the same problem. Knowing exactly what problem you need to solve will also keep your users’ needs top-of-mind.

**Establish a creative environment.** You’ll need a comfortable space where everyone on your team can get together and present their ideas. If you’re meeting in person, choose an ideation space that’s different from your usual workspace. If you’re ideating virtually, try to find a different space in your home that’s free of clutter and distractions.

**Set a time limit.** There are an endless number of possible products and features you could design, so give yourself plenty of time to come up with ideas. However, you can’t brainstorm forever, so you’ll also need to set a time to stop brainstorming and start thinking more deeply about the ideas you’ve come up with.

**Assemble a diverse team.** You’re trying to come up with as many different ideas as possible. An inclusive team of people, with different races, genders, abilities, and backgrounds, will help you come up with all kinds of solutions.

**Think outside the box.** Don’t limit yourself to traditional ideas and solutions. If you have a cool idea that seems a little different, write it down! Think big and get creative while ideating. 

There’s no right or wrong way to practice design ideation. There are many techniques you can use to come up with ideas. If you want to learn more, check out this article from CareerFoundry, A Guide To The Most Important Ideation Techniques, which highlights some common design ideation techniques. Once you start ideating for your own projects, you may even come up with your own version of one of these techniques!

##### The importance of design ideation

While design ideation can take a significant amount of time, it's also a lot of fun! You’ll generate many possible solutions, and you’ll end up using one, or a few, of your original ideas. This is perfectly normal in the UX design process, and it’s an exciting part of the working with a team. Narrowing down many ideas to a couple of great ones is very rewarding.

Design ideation encourages you to come up with solutions that are unique. Don’t settle for your first solution. In fact, the first few solutions you suggest are often the least creative because they’re the most obvious. When generating ideas, you should use your creative powers to their full potential.

Following the design process outlined in this certificate program will lay the foundation for your product’s design. The more effort you put into empathizing with your users, defining the problems they’re facing, and coming up with ideas for solutions, the better your end result will be.

### Explore lots of ideas

##### Why should we come up with a lot of ideas? 

- List of ideas is narrowed based on constraints 
- Need to focus on equity 
- Let users test the ideas

### Scope the competition 
##### Competitive audit
A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors' strengths and weaknesses.

##### What you can learn from a competitive audit.
- Identifying your key competitors 
- Reviewing the products that your competitors offer
- Understanding how your competitors position themselves in the market 
- Examining what your competition does well and what they could do better 
- Considering how your competitors talk about themselves 

##### Benefits to competitive audits 

- Inform your design process
- Solve usability problem 
- Reveal gaps in the market 
- Provide reliable evidence 
- Save time, money, and energy 

**Direct competitors** have offerings, meaning products, services, or features, that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience.

Indirect competitors are a little more nuanced. They either have a similar set of offerings, but focus on a different audience than you, or they have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience as you.

### Reading: Learn more about competitive audits

Competitive audits are one of the many valuable steps you can take during the ideation process. A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. Analyzing the brands and products of competitors, or the companies who offer similar products as you do, can give you a well-rounded foundation of knowledge about the market your product will enter. That knowledge will carry into your designs and help you create a product that’s helpful and unique for users. As a UX designer, you’ll likely partner with folks from other teams, like marketing or product management, to run a competitive audit. 

Your competition falls into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct competitors are companies that have offerings similar to your product and focus on the same audience. Indirect competitors can have a similar set of offerings and a different audience, or a different set of offerings with the same audience. Examining both of these competitors can offer insights about the path your designs might take and the users that you’re designing for. 

##### Why are competitive audits important?

Consider how much work your direct and indirect competitors have already done to design and market their products to users. They’ve already had an impact on the industry that your product will enter. Studying these companies, their designs, and their user feedback is a fantastic source of information. 

Competitive audits can offer many benefits throughout your ideation phase, including:

- Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their designs. 
- Suggesting ideas to solve early problems that you’re facing with your own designs. 
- Revealing the ways that current products in the market are not meeting users’ needs. This is a gap for your product to address!
- Demonstrating the expected life cycle of a product in the same market as yours.
- Informing all the different iterations your product could take and how those performed for your competitors. 

With these benefits in mind, you can work with your team to identify the features and qualifications that you think are vital to your product. You'll focus your audit on the parts of your own design that you want to learn the most about, like the user flow through your app or the navigation within the app. A little self-reflection about the designs you're working on will set up your audit for success from the start. 

By investing time into competitive audits, your team will be able to learn from the mistakes of your competitors and can avoid making those mistakes yourselves. Think of audits as a tool to help you create something for your users that’s completely different from the competition, combing all of the strengths of your competitors’ offerings into one fantastic product!

### Limits to competitive audits

- Stifle creativity 
- Depend on how well you interpret the findings 
- Not all designs work in all use cases 
- Need to be done regularly

### Reading: Steps to conduct a competitive audit

You’ve already learned that conducting research on competitors is the cornerstone to understanding your product, the landscape of your industry, and your users. Completing a competitive audit is an effective way to compile all of your research into one central resource. In this reading, we’ll break down each step of the competitive audit process in more detail, as an example to introduce you to the process, and in a later activity, you’ll conduct your own competitive audit.

For this example, imagine you’re conducting competitive research on fast food burger restaurants for your new client, Burger Garden. Burger Garden feels that their current website isn’t attracting much business, and they want you to help the company design a new website. 

You can use this completed competitor audit spreadsheet to follow along with the example in this reading. 

##### Step 1. Outline the audit goals

As a UX designer, you know that the ideation process is most effective after you’ve completed an audit on your new client, Burger Garden, and their competitors. But before you move into the details of the audit, you have to define your goals. Creating an outline or rubric that lays out the goals and expectations of your audit is the first step in the competitive audit process. An outline or rubric can also create more uniform feedback and can help you “grade” competitors against the product you’re focusing on. 

The image below shows the rubric for the Burger Garden competitive audit. You can grade competitors on a scale of needs work, okay, good, and outstanding, based on the description below each grade.

##### Step 2. List competitors

Start to build the competitor audit using the template. First, ask the company or team who they consider to be their direct and indirect competitors. As a reminder, direct competitors have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience. Indirect competitors either have a similar set of offerings but focus on a different audience, or they have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience. Getting this information early can provide good insight into where the company really fits into their industry.

For example, Burger Garden mentioned that Beef Eaters restaurant is one of their direct competitors, so they should be included on the list. Based on your own research, you find two more direct competitors that are also burger restaurants in the same geographical area as Burger Garden, called Burger Nest and The Spotty Cow. You also come across an indirect competitor, The Vegan Cow, that has an international presence and really appealing imagery on their website. The competitor audit spreadsheet now includes the information shown below.

![](/Week5/week5images/2.png)
##### Step 3. Determine the specific features you want to compare

Defining a list of features you want to compare makes it easier to compile your results for analysis later on in the process. For this example, imagine that you check out each of the competitors’ websites and rate them based on the following categories:  

- **Audience:** Consider the website with the company's target audience in mind. Is the website actually attracting their target audience?
- **First impressions:** Check out the website on both desktop and mobile devices, and make note of your first impressions. Is the website responsive, meaning that it resizes across devices? Does the design complement the product? How do you feel about the website?
- **Interaction:** Explore the user flow and navigation of the website. Will the user get confused as they click through the website pages, or is the navigation clear? Is the website accessible to all users, including those using screen readers?
- **Visual design:** Review competitor branding and their overall consistency. Does the website appear and feel the same throughout all sections and pages? Does the branding match the intended audience? Is the imagery and color palette memorable? 
- **Content:** Examine the written content included on the website. Does the tone of the content match the company’s branding? Will users be able to find the details they’re interested in? How inclusive is their website to non-English speakers?

These are the features to list across the top row of the competitor audit. In the example spreadsheet, these features are listed in rows 3 and 4. This means you would fill in information about these features for each of the companies you’re evaluating. 

##### Step 4. Research each company

Now that the list of competitors and features to compare is filled in, it’s time to check out each of Burger Garden’s competitors and start the audit. If you were conducting your own audit, you would fill out the spreadsheet row-by-row as you review each competitor. You can include notes in bullet point form, links, and screenshots — whatever is most helpful for your information gathering process! 

##### Step 5. Analyze your findings 

Now, imagine that you’ve done your research on each company and compiled the data into a spreadsheet. You're ready to analyze that data and identify trends and insights. Let’s check out each section of the example spreadsheet. 

###### Audience

Millennials, including families, make up the biggest portion of the competitors’ audiences. There’s also a small crossover between millennials and Gen-Z college students. This is very similar to the audience that Burger Garden is targeting. Only one competitor, The Vegan Cow, has a different audience. That’s okay! The Vegan Cow wasn’t included as a direct competitor because their audience isn’t similar to Burger Garden’s. It’s still important to compare their website and overall user experience to ensure you’re getting a good sense of the entire market. 

![](/Week5/week5images/3.png)
###### First impressions

The websites that make the best first impression are The Spotty Cow and The Vegan Cow. Both provide appealing and clear imagery, and are fully responsive websites. On the other end, the websites for Beef Eaters and Burger Nest weren’t very impressive. While they’re easy to navigate, they both need to work on improving their layouts. 

For the mobile website experience, only one site had issues with responsiveness: Beef Eaters. Their website didn’t adjust to the smaller screen size of a mobile phone, so the spacing was misaligned and some information was cut off. 

For the sites with lower ratings, the biggest issue was the menu. Sometimes the menu wasn’t accessible, and other times the menu was included as an image that was hard to read. That’s definitely something to make note of for your redesign of the Burger Garden website!  

![](/Week5/week5images/4.png)

###### Interaction

The next part of the competitive audit focuses on the user’s ability to quickly and efficiently find what they’re searching for on the website. Your client, Burger Garden, needs help to create a hierarchy for their site that’s easier for users to follow and interact with. 

The Spotty Cow’s website includes animations that slow the navigation, and The Burger Nest’s site has lots of unnecessary content on the homepage, which makes it hard to find important information like their phone number and menu. On the other end of the spectrum, the websites that work well have a clear navigation style and make it obvious which elements are clickable and which aren’t — a characteristic it’s important to include in the redesign of Burger Garden’s website. 

![](/Week5/week5images/5.png)

###### Visual design

A website with clear and consistent visual design is a great way to draw users into a product and company. Burger Garden’s current website has pretty solid visual design overall, but there are a few areas that could be updated to better reflect their brand tone. 

The Spotty Cow and The Vegan Cow communicate their brand well with distinct colors, typography, and photography. But Burger Nest and Beef Eaters both have an inconsistent visual style on their websites, and Burger Nest’s site doesn’t communicate their brand very well.  

![](/Week5/week5images/6.png)

###### Content

The tone of the content is another way to communicate a company’s brand and engage users. Most of Burger Garden’s competitors use an engaging and fun tone that fits their audiences. Burger Garden’s tone is a little inconsistent and not as light-hearted as its competitors. This is an area for improvement when you redesign their website! 

In general, the competitors’ content is short and easy to follow. Burger Garden’s current website descriptions come off as a bit dry and overly long, so you can point to competitors’ content as an example to follow.

![](/Week5/week5images/7.png)

##### Step 6. Summarize your findings in a report

After conducting research, gathering data, and analyzing your findings, summarize your work in a report. What you include in your report and how you present your findings will vary depending on the audit goals you outlined at the beginning of the process. For example, if your audit mainly focuses on comparing competitors’ audiences, you might want to include a few informational graphics with numbers and figures. Or, if your audit mainly focuses on visual design, you might want to include screenshots of your competitors’ websites with different areas highlighted. 

Regardless of the focus of your audit, it can be helpful to include the rubric that grades the features of each of your competitors’ websites at the beginning of your report, to help the audience follow along. You’ll learn how to create a report summarizing your research findings in more detail later on in the program, so don’t worry too much about it right now!

###### Completing your audit 
Conducting a competitive audit is a great way to familiarize yourself with user experience design by getting more information about a new industry, a new client, and recent industry trends. The information you learn can be used throughout the design process. If you can, it’s best to take your time with the competitive audit process so you’ll have a great foundation of knowledge to build your designs on moving forward. Good luck!

### Use How Might We to ideate

**"How Might We"** is a design thinking activity used to translate problems into opportunities for design. 

How Might We? 

- "How" - Explore a bunch of ideas 

The word "how" encourages us to explore a bunch of ideas instead of moving forward with only one idea for the solution.

- "Might" - Our ideas are possible solutions. not the only solution


- "We" - Collaborative effort 

The word "we" suggests a collaborative effort.

### Reading: Best practices for How Might We

Brainstorming possible solutions to your design problems is an opportunity to get creative and have some fun! The “How might we” exercise is one of the most common ways to approach the ideation process.

**“How might we” (HMW)** is a design thinking activity used to translate problems into opportunities for design. HMW gets your creativity flowing and encourages you to think about the problem from different perspectives. This new vantage point helps you create a wide variety of solutions to the user problem you’re trying to address. During a HMW exercise, you’ll create a list of questions that start with “How might we” and use those to spark ideas for solutions.

##### Frame HMW questions

To create good HMW questions, you need a well-defined problem statement. From there, you can reframe this problem statement into questions that will help you come up with ideas to solve the problem.

Consider this problem that a user, Darren, faces: Darren is a concert goer who needs to keep track of their concert ticket because they need the ticket when they go through security. 

Let’s revisit those useful tips from the Stanford University design school that you learned about in the video. These tips will help you reframe the problem from different angles.

If you want more inspiration, check out Stanford’s one-pager on “how might we” questions. 

##### Best practices for thinking of HMWs

Coming up with good HMWs takes a little practice, but you’ll get the hang of it in no time! To start your ideation process on the right track, here are some best practices to keep in mind:

- **Be broad.** A good HMW should allow for multiple solutions. For example, one of the earlier questions, How might we make keeping track of tickets fun and competitive?, can be answered in countless ways.

- **But don’t be too broad.** You want your HMWs to be comprehensive, but narrow enough to keep your solutions focused. An example of a HMW question that is too broad is: How might we make ticketing better? This HMW doesn’t provide clear enough guidance to come up with ideas for solutions.

- **Make multiple drafts.** It’s okay to change your HMW questions after you’ve written them. If you find that your HMW doesn’t help you think of any useful solutions, change it up!

- **Be creative.** HMWs are meant to be imaginative and even fun. You can use the list of tips from Stanford above to think of new, creative ways to frame your questions.

- **Write as many HMWs as you can.** The more HMWs you have, the more solutions you can come up with. If you can make more than one question out of the frameworks you’ve learned, then go for it!

Now, you’re ready to come up with your own HMW questions for the app you’re going to design. HMWs are a great way to start thinking of potential solutions during the ideate stage of the design process. Good luck, and get creative!

### Reading: Best practices for Crazy Eights

How do you feel about putting your ideas on paper? Your sketches are the starting point for creating a new product. In this reading, you’ll learn more about Crazy Eights, a popular design ideation exercise that helps you think of several ideas in record time.

The Crazy Eights exercise is a great way to get ideas flowing for any design problem you need to solve. With Crazy Eights, you’ll sketch eight different designs, each with a new idea for solving the user’s problem. The best part? It only takes eight minutes! Here’s a reminder of how it works:

- **Start with a large sheet of paper.** Fold the paper in half, then fold it in half again, then in half one more time. When you unfold the paper, you’ll have eight squares to sketch in.
- **Grab something to draw with.** A lot of designers prefer to draw using Sharpies, but a pencil or pen will work too. You can use whatever you already have to draw. 
- **Set your timer to eight minutes.** You’ll have one minute to sketch each design idea.
- **Let the ideas flow.** Draw any and every solution that comes to your mind. If you have more than eight ideas, feel free to repeat the exercise.

Just like that, you’ve got eight potential design solutions! Keep in mind that this exercise is often done in a group setting. Each person draws eight sketches on their own, then the group comes together to decide on their favorite ideas. Each person shares their top two or three ideas with the whole group, or each person may vote on their favorite sketches from across the team. The best ideas chosen will usually be elaborated on through more detailed sketches.

##### Best practices
Now that you know how to do a Crazy Eights exercise, check out some tips to make your creativity flow freely while you sketch.

- **Do a creative warm-up exercise.** Complete an activity where you draw the person next to you without looking at your paper, or have everyone draw their own interpretation of a word or phrase. Starting to put pen to paper like this will get you in the mindset to sketch.

- **Make sure your problem is well defined.** Develop a set of Crazy Eights for one How might we question or one problem statement at a time.

- **Don’t judge your ideas.** Ideating is all about creating lots of ideas, not creating perfect ones! Sketch any and every idea you have until your paper is full, no matter how crazy it might seem.

- **Don’t judge other people’s ideas.** Keep an open mind when other people are presenting their sketches. 

- **Include a diverse group.** Since Crazy Eights are often done in a group setting, it’s best that your group represents a variety of work roles, experiences, abilities, genders, and backgrounds. This will help your team have a wide range of ideas to choose from.

- **Ideate in a comfortable environment.** Do this exercise in a location that’s relaxed and encourages creative thinking. It’s always great to get out of your normal work space for creative exercises.

- **Don’t be afraid of sketching.** You don’t have to be an artist to be a UX designer, and your sketches during Crazy Eights don’t have to be perfect. You just need to clearly communicate your ideas. Stick figures are perfectly fine!

##### Benefits of Crazy Eights

Crazy Eights is an exciting design ideation exercise that generates a lot of ideas in a small amount of time. If you have five people do the exercise at the same time, you’ll have 40 potential solutions after only eight minutes. That’s a lot of ideas!

Crazy Eights also forces you **to think outside the box** because you have to come up with many ideas in a short timeframe, without judging them. This means that you will have lots of unique, nontraditional solutions to consider.

This exercise is meant to be fun and fast paced, so enjoy yourself. Let your creativity flow without judgement, and come up with some awesome ideas!
