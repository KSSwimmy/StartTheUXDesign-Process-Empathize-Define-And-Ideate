# WEEK 4: 

### Create problem statements 

A problem statement is a clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed.

Problem statements align the team on which user problem to focus on, giving everyone a clear goal.

Problem statement is:

- Human-centered 
- Broad enough for creative freedom 
- Narrow enough to be solved by a design 

#### Problem Statements Formula


    ____________ is __________ who needs __________ 
      user name   user charactoristics   user need

    because __________
             insight

Effective Problem Statement 
- Establish goals 
- Understand constraints 
- Define deliverables 
- Create benchmarks for success

### Reading: Define problem statements

Identifying the problems that users face is one of the most important parts of UX design. But as critical as research is to the UX design process, some of your work will still require a small amount of “mind reading” about the user’s experience. That might seem like it’s contradicting the rule of never making assumptions, but sometimes users just won’t feel comfortable or know how to express exactly what their problem is and how it affects them. In this reading, you’ll learn how to define unspoken pain points and use them to form strong problem statements.

##### The connection between pain points and problem statements

As a reminder, **pain points** are any UX issue or friction that frustrates the user and blocks them from getting what they need. Minimizing pain points keeps users happy and encourages them to keep interacting with the product. So, how do UX designers find and define pain points? 

Think about the dog walker app and one of our user personas, Arnold. Arnold is in his late fifties, and his kids have encouraged him to upgrade to a smartphone. Arnold is a leader at his company, and not used to admitting he's uncomfortable with technology. After his wife died, Arnold became the primary caregiver of the family's animals. But, he works over sixty hours per week, and is unable to take his three dogs on twice-daily walks. Arnold is turning to the dog walker app for help. 

You learned earlier that there are four categories pain points can fall into: 

- **Financial**, or money-related pain points. 
- **Product**, which are pain points related to quality issues. 
- **Process**, which are pain points related to the user’s journey. 
- **Support**, which are pain points related to getting help from customer service.

Identifying the pain points your user is experiencing will help you find potential problems that your design can solve. Arnold’s pain points fall into the process category. His biggest challenge is that he's not technologically savvy, so he struggles to understand how to use the app.

Now that you’ve identified Arnold’s pain points, you need to be sure you know enough about his needs to write a problem statement. **Problem statements** provide a clear description of the user’s need that should be addressed. To build a problem statement, you can utilize the 5 Ws framework.


##### The 5 Ws and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how

The most common framework used to create problem statements is the 5 Ws and H framework. After you define the user’s pain points, you can answer who, what, when, where, why, and how to solve the user’s problem.

**Who** is experiencing the problem? Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.

**What** are the pain points you’re trying to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.

**Where** is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.

**When** does the problem occur? Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings. 

**Why** is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.

**How** are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

To design a solution that fits the needs of your users, you have to understand the problem from their point of view. Thinking through the 5 Ws and how forces you to write out who the user is and describe the full context of the problem from the user’s perspective.

Okay, back to the dog walker app! You know a bit about Arnold already, but use the skills you’ve learned so far to confirm you know enough to solve his pain points. 

- **Who:** A busy executive
- **What:** Arnold wants to hire a daily dog walker for his three dogs.
- **Where:** Arnold is likely using the app at work, on the go. 
- **When:** Arnold gets frustrated when he opens the app, starting from the very beginning of the user journey. 
- **Why:** Arnold doesn’t have a lot of experience with phone apps or similar technology. 
- **How:** Arnold wants to go easily from the home screen of the app to the list of dog walkers to the confirmation screen. 

Ta-da! You were able to successfully answer all six questions. Now that you’ve thought through your user’s needs, you’re ready to define the final problem statement. 

##### The problem statement formula 
So, how do you create a problem statement? Start by defining who the user is and what their needs and motivations are. Here’s the formula we introduced in the video:

Okay, now apply the formula to Arnold. Arnold is a busy professional who needs a dog walker. But what’s the insight? His phone! His kids gave him a shiny, new smartphone. Arnold shared that he often struggles with technology and is having an issue navigating the app. 

![](/Week4/week4images/problemstatementEx.png)
**Arnold** is a **busy executive** who needs **an easy app experience to hire a dog walker** because **he's not technologically savvy.**


##### The impact of problem statements

Problem statements provide clarity about your users’ goals and help UX designers identify constraints that prevent users from meeting those goals. Problem statements also help your team measure success. If you expect that Arnold and users like him will engage the most with your app, you should make the app clear and easy for them to understand. 

The designs you create matter! Empathize with your user as much as you can to make a product that they’ll want to interact with and use every day.

### Define hypothesis statements

##### Hypothesis Statement
A hypothesis statement writes out our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design problem might be.

### Reading: Define hypothesis statements

You’ve spent a lot of time learning who your user is and how empathy and user research can help you improve your understanding of your users' needs. In this reading, you’ll learn how to use that knowledge to create hypothesis statements. 

##### Implementing what you’ve learned so far
Take a moment to review what you’ve learned so far. 

**Empathizing** with users allows you to consider the experience from the users’ perspectives and discover their likes, dislikes, and pain points. 

**Defining** involves sorting through the user research you collected during the empathize phase. Analyzing that user research helps you create a problem statement. 

Once you’ve analyzed your research and understand your users’ problems, you can begin coming up with solutions. That’s where you’re at in the design process now! You’re ready to create **hypothesis statements**.

##### Creating hypothesis statements
A **hypothesis statement** is an educated guess about what you think the solution to a design problem might be. You know your user’s problems, so it’s time to problem solve and consider solutions.

Hypothesis statements don’t have a standard formula, but there are two common methods for building them. First, you can use an “if / then” statement to come up with a hypothesis. 

Here are some examples of if/then hypothesis statements applied to the users of the dog walker app:

- **If** Arnold downloads the dog walker app, **then** they can utilize the “simplified” mode setting to view only the basic app functions. 
- **If** Tobias signs up for the dog walker app, **then** they will quickly and easily pick a walker that fits their schedule.

The second common method for building hypothesis statements is “we believe” statements. 

- **We believe** that a simplified mode of the dog walker app for Arnold will allow them to hire dog walkers efficiently.
- **We believe** that easy access to available dog walkers for Tobias will increase the amount of walks they choose for their pets. 

“If/then” statements focus directly on the needs of your users. “We believe” statements take the perspective of your team into account, while remaining empathetic to the needs of your users.

You might encounter situations where you have multiple hypothesis statements for one problem statement. That’s okay! There will always be multiple solutions for your users’ problems. Your job as a UX designer is to use your creativity and problem-solving skills to decide which solutions work best for the unique users you’re designing for.

##### The importance of hypothesis statements
Hypothesis statements help you narrow down your research insights into goals for your product, so you can stay focused on the wants and needs of your users.

### Reading: Determine a value proposition

Have you ever encountered a product or app and thought, “I have to have this!”? That’s not a coincidence! This is the dream for UX designers because we want to create products that provide a clear value for users. 

So, how can you use everything you’ve built so far — empathy maps, personas, user stories, problem statements, and hypothesis statements — to make users think, “I have to have this!”? 

Start by defining your product’s value propositions. **Value propositions** summarize why a consumer should use a product or service. 

##### Value proposition example

Check out a product you might recognize - Gmail – and ask yourself if you can identify a few of its value propositions. When Google debuted Gmail in 2004, they were entering an already crowded market of free email services. Gmail offered: 

- The ability to send and receive emails for free
- Email sorting, archiving, and starring functions
- Spam filtering for inboxes
- Email conversation views
- 1 gigabyte of cloud storage

Two of the items on that list were unique offerings that no other email services provided at the time: email conversation views, which put individual emails in the context of a larger thread, and an entire gigabyte of storage, which was 1,000 times the amount of storage that competitors offered. Those were Gmail’s unique value propositions. 

##### Build value propositions

Everything that your product has to offer might seem obvious to you, but you have to put yourself in the mind of your users. Users don’t know your product or understand its value yet. That’s where value propositions come in. 

To start, you need to do some research in order to answer these two questions:

- **What does your product do? Clearly explain the offering that your product provides users.**
- **Why should the user care? Describe how your product addresses users’ pain points.**

Once you’ve answered these questions, you can follow a series of steps to focus in on your product’s unique value proposition. Let’s use the dog walker app as an example to explore how this works in action.

**Step 1. Describe your product’s features and benefits.** Create a list of all the great features and benefits of your product, big and small. Don’t hold back; list everything that comes to mind and then narrow it down later.

**Step 2. Explain the value of the product.** Anything that you identify as a value proposition needs to be beneficial to your users. In this example, for the dog walker app, there were four categories of product values that were identified during user interviews: accessible, professional experience of the dog walkers, cost, and reliability. The giant list of features and benefits from step one is sorted into those four categories.

There were a few features and benefits from the original list that didn't fit into these four categories and didn't add real “value” for the users: 

Monthly organic goodies and new products for your pets
Exclusively for dog walking (no other kinds of pets)
Rating system for walkers
Training tips
These features and benefits were not sorted into the four categories and were instead set to the side. 

**Step 3. Connect these features and benefits with the needs of your users.** The goal is to identify what’s truly valuable to the user and not just a cool feature that users didn’t ask for. To determine value, take the personas you’ve developed and pair each persona with a value proposition that meets their biggest pain point.

**Step 4. Review your official value proposition list.** You’ve narrowed your list down of lots of benefits and features by matching them with actual user needs. Now it’s time to review the list of value propositions your product offers. For the dog walker app, here are the value propositions that matched with the personas that were developed earlier: 

- Thorough training for walkers
- Upgrade dog walkers to dog nanny for set, scheduled walks
- Geo-tracking of walkers 
- Calendar booking
- Late-notice cancellation fees
- Convenient lockers that hold your house keys 
- Easy-to-use app design 

And there you have it, your list of value propositions! However, some of these features and benefits are also offered by your competitors. So how do you know what makes your product stand out from the competition? Identify your app’s unique value proposition. This means reviewing the list of value propositions that match to your personas and removing those that your competition also offers. 

One way to check out your product’s competitors is to read reviews. Sort the reviews from lowest to highest, and closely examine what reviewers are sharing about your competition. Here are some reviews about a competitor dog walking app:

Can you identify the biggest pain point in this example? A common theme in some of the reviews is the need for thorough, in-person training for the dog walkers, to ensure that the dog walkers know how to do their jobs well. Some of the reviews also call out the need for dog walkers to be reliable. No other dog walking app is meeting this need, so that’s the unique value proposition our app can provide!

##### Key takeaways

One of the most important things to know about value propositions is that they need to be short, clear, and to the point. Users want to be able to easily identify exactly how your product will meet their unique needs and what sets your product apart in the market. Sometimes users won’t know what they need until you explain it to them. That’s the real heart of product design innovation.

### Understand human factors 

##### The human factor
The human factor describes the range of variables humans bring to their product interactions.

##### Common human factors that influence design 

- Impatience 
- Limited memory 
- Needing analogies 
- Limited concentration
- Changes in need 
- Needing motivation 
- Prejudices 
- Fears 
- Making errors 
- Misjudgment 

Here are psychological concepts that can help you design with the human factor in mind.

##### Mental Model
Mental models are internal maps that allow humans to predict how something will work.

When you face a door, your mental model tells you that the door can be opened. Once the door is opened, you'll be able to leave the room. The process of opening the door is expected to end with you being able to leave the room. A mental model breaks when you can't go through the open door because, for example, there's a solid brick wall behind it.


##### Feedback loops
Feedback loops refer to the outcome a user gets at the end of a process.

For example, if you enter a dark room and flip a light switch, the room will either brighten, or it won't. Positive feedback would be the light coming on. While negative feedback would be nothing happening. The more positive feedback a user gets when completing the action, the more they will expect the outcome to be positive.
